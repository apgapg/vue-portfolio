          '\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/270/1*1Bsy0cQhyVQh4Edyhikzjw.png"></figure><p>Every flutter developer comes across this famous error screen, quite often, during their initial stages. While this seems to be most irritating when you are a beginner, but yet, this is one of the most highlighting feature provided by Flutter which remarkably differentiates it from other developing tools in the market atleast native Android developement.</p>\n<p>As per the docs, Flutter generates red screen error <strong>whenever a widget fails to build.</strong> If you take a peek into <strong>StatefulWidget.dart</strong> class, you will see this code being invoken in <strong>performRebuild()</strong> method:</p>\n<pre>@override<br><em>void </em>performRebuild() {</pre>\n<pre>  //..//<br><em>try </em>{<br>    built = build();<br>    debugWidgetBuilderValue(widget, built);<br>  } <em>catch </em>(e, stack) {<br>    built = ErrorWidget.<em>builder</em>(_debugReportException(\'building $<em>this</em>\', e, stack));<br>  }</pre>\n<pre> //..//<br>}</pre>\n<p>In this you can see this <strong>Red Screen Error</strong> is nothing but <strong>a widget named</strong> <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ErrorWidget-class.html"><strong>ErrorWidget</strong></a> provided by framework.</p>\n<blockquote>Note that this ErrorWidget will be invoked only when a widget building fails, so that ErrorWidget replaces it when an error occurs in build method of that widget. That’s why its visible only in the area occupied by the widget that has failed to built.</blockquote>\n<p>What if you want to display this red screen error without being depended on <strong>‘widget building fails’</strong> condition?</p>\n<p>For eg, you are having a list of strings like this:</p>\n<pre>List&lt;String&gt; _list = ["Flutter", "Android", "iOS"];</pre>\n<p>What if you want to test it for null value and want to show a red screen error ? Well you can use ‘<strong>assert’</strong> :</p>\n<pre><em>assert</em>(_list!=<em>null</em>,"List is null");</pre>\n<p>But this statement will not show a red screen error if a widget hasn’t got affected by the list null value. <strong>‘assert’</strong> in this case simply logs the message onto the console.</p>\n<h4>What if we want a red screen instead?</h4>\n<p>For achieving this let’s make a new Flutter project named <a href="https://github.com/apgapg/flutter_red_screen_error">flutter_red_screen_error</a>.</p>\n<p>Here we have simply three files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/apgapg/flutter_red_screen_error/tree/master/lib">main.dart</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/apgapg/flutter_red_screen_error/tree/master/lib">home_page.dart</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/apgapg/flutter_red_screen_error/tree/master/lib">first_page.dart</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In <strong>home_page</strong> i have a button which simply shows the first page and <strong>a list is passed from home_page to first page</strong>:</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*M_edKAxBWw7THjojDJKJtA.png"></figure><p>What if the list passed to first page is <strong>null</strong>?

          '\n<h3>Flutter : ListView, GridView inside ScrollView</h3>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*EV0ISPIhC8Yrf9nEwSJEMQ.gif"></figure><p>Sometimes you need to use a ListView or GridView inside a ScrollView (SingleChildScrollView). We know this isn’t a good practise as you can’t put a ListView being a Scrollable widget inside ScrollView, but for some reason i wanted to achieve this, especially when i want to show both ListView and GridView at the same time.</p>\n<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when you put a <strong>ListView inside a SingleChildScrollView</strong>.</p>\n<p>Create a new project and embed the following code:</p>\n<pre><em>return </em>Scaffold(<br>  appBar: AppBar(<br>    title: Text("ListView"),<br>  ),<br>  body: Container(<br>    child: SingleChildScrollView(<br>      child: Column(<br>        children: &lt;Widget&gt;[<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 1"),<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 2"),<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 3"),<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 4"),<br>          ListView(<br>            children: &lt;Widget&gt;[<br>              BodyWidget(Colors.<em>blue</em>),<br>              BodyWidget(Colors.<em>red</em>),<br>              BodyWidget(Colors.<em>green</em>),<br>            ],<br>          ),<br>        ],<br>      ),<br>    ),<br>  ),<br><em>// This trailing comma makes auto-formatting nicer for build methods.<br></em>);</pre>\n<p>The <strong>HeaderWidget</strong> and <strong>BodyWidget</strong> are just simple widgets. (These are separated just to maintain the readability of the code)</p>\n<pre><em>class </em>HeaderWidget <em>extends </em>StatelessWidget {<br><em>final </em>String text;<br><br>  HeaderWidget(<em>this</em>.text);<br><br>  @override<br>  Widget build(BuildContext context) {<br><em>return </em>Container(<br>      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),<br>      child: Text(text),<br>      color: Colors.<em>grey</em>[200],<br>    );<br>  }<br>}<br><br><em>class </em>BodyWidget <em>extends </em>StatelessWidget {<br><em>final </em>Color color;<br><br>  BodyWidget(<em>this</em>.color);<br><br>  @override<br>  Widget build(BuildContext context) {<br><em>return </em>Container(<br>      height: 100.0,<br>      color: color,<br>      alignment: Alignment.<em>center</em>,<br><br>    );<br>  }<br>}</pre>\n<p>If you run the above code, you get an exception in the console.</p>\n<pre>══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY╞══════════════════════<br>I/flutter ( 3423): The following assertion was thrown during performResize():<br>I/flutter ( 3423): Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.<br>I/flutter ( 3423): Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container.In this case, a vertical<br>I/flutter ( 3423): viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. <strong>This situation<br>I/flutter ( 3423): typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.</strong><br>I/flutter ( 3423): If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because<br>I/flutter ( 3423): there will always be enough vertical space for the children.

We know this isn’t a good practise as you can’t put a ListView being a Scrollable widget inside ScrollView, but for some reason i wanted to achieve this, especially when i want to show both ListView and GridView at the same time.</p>\n<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when you put a <strong>ListView inside a SingleChildScrollView</strong>.</p>\n<p>Create a new project and embed the following code:</p>\n<pre><em>return </em>Scaffold(<br>  appBar: AppBar(<br>    title: Text("ListView"),<br>  ),<br>  body: Container(<br>    child: SingleChildScrollView(<br>      child: Column(<br>        children: &lt;Widget&gt;[<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 1"),<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 2"),<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 3"),<br>          HeaderWidget("Header 4"),<br>          ListView(<br>            children: &lt;Widget&gt;[<br>              BodyWidget(Colors.<em>blue</em>),<br>              BodyWidget(Colors.<em>red</em>),<br>              BodyWidget(Colors.<em>green</em>),<br>            ],<br>          ),<br>        ],<br>      ),<br>    ),<br>  ),<br><em>// This trailing comma makes auto-formatting nicer for build methods.<br></em>);</pre>\n<p>The <strong>HeaderWidget</strong> and <strong>BodyWidget</strong> are just simple widgets. (These are separated just to maintain the readability of the code)</p>\n<pre><em>class </em>HeaderWidget <em>extends </em>StatelessWidget {<br><em>final </em>String text;<br><br>  HeaderWidget(<em>this</em>.text);<br><br>  @override<br>  Widget build(BuildContext context) {<br><em>return </em>Container(<br>      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),<br>      child: Text(text),<br>      color: Colors.<em>grey</em>[200],<br>    );<br>  }<br>}<br><br><em>class </em>BodyWidget <em>extends </em>StatelessWidget {<br><em>final </em>Color color;<br><br>  BodyWidget(<em>this</em>.color);<br><br>  @override<br>  Widget build(BuildContext context) {<br><em>return </em>Container(<br>      height: 100.0,<br>      color: color,<br>      alignment: Alignment.<em>center</em>,<br><br>    );<br>  }<br>}</pre>\n<p>If you run the above code, you get an exception in the console.</p>\n<pre>══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY╞══════════════════════<br>I/flutter ( 3423): The following assertion was thrown during performResize():<br>I/flutter ( 3423): Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.<br>I/flutter ( 3423): Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container.In this case, a vertical<br>I/flutter ( 3423): viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. <strong>This situation<br>I/flutter ( 3423): typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.</strong><br>I/flutter ( 3423): If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because<br>I/flutter ( 3423): there will always be enough vertical space for the children.

          '\n<p>Since the start of our project, we were having a constant pain in debugging/releasing android apk on different OS like Windows, Linux.

Flutter docs about <a href="https://flutter.io/android-release/">releasing an android</a> apk asks in one step to <strong>‘<em>Reference the keystore from the app</em>’</strong> i.e. create a file named <strong>‘key.properties’</strong> whose contents in our case looks like this:</p>\n<pre><em>storePassword</em>=**123<br><em>keyPassword</em>=**3<br><em>keyAlias</em>=key<br><em>storeFile</em>=C:\\\\Users\\\\Varun\\\\Desktop\\\\***.jks</pre>\n<p>Now because my teammate uses Windows, hence the path of keystore is different, even though it is in same directory inside our project.

          '\n<p>One of the most beloved package that i like in flutter is the <strong>json_annotation</strong>. JSON parsing has never been so fun for me as that in dart. The reason might be my ignorance with JSON or may be this package is really better than others.</p>\n<p>Basic JSON parsing is well explained here at <a href="https://flutter.io/json/">official site</a>. And because it was already clearly explained, hence i will not dive into the basics of parsing. Also i will assume that the reader has at least tried simple JSON parsing in Flutter.</p>\n<p>So before starting let’s make a simple json_parsing project in flutter.</p>\n<p>Here’s the sample JSON that we’ll be using thereafter:</p>\n<pre>{<br> “id”: “12”,<br> “name”: “Ayush”,<br> “nickname”: “apgapg”,<br> “avatar”: “<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg</a>",<br> “profile_complete”: false<br>}</pre>\n<p>We’ll be needing a model class for parsing it:</p>\n<pre><em>import </em>\'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart\';<br><br><em>part </em>\'sample_model.g.dart\';<br><br>@JsonSerializable()<br><em>class </em>SampleModel {<br><em>final </em>String id;<br><em>final </em>String name;<br><em>final </em>String nickname;<br><em>final </em>String avatar;<br><em>final </em>bool profile_complete;<br><br>  SampleModel(<em>this</em>.id, <em>this</em>.name, <em>this</em>.nickname, <em>this</em>.avatar, <em>this</em>.profile_complete);<br><br><em>factory </em>SampleModel.fromJson(Map&lt;String, <em>dynamic</em>&gt; json) =&gt; _$SampleModelFromJson(json);<br>}</pre>\n<p>Finally here’s the homepage where the main implementation takes place: (only State is shown)</p>\n<pre><em>class </em>_MyHomePageState <em>extends </em>State&lt;MyHomePage&gt; {<br>  SampleModel sampleModel;<br><em>final </em>textStyle = TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0);<br><br>  @override<br><em>void </em>initState() {<br><em>super</em>.initState();</pre>\n<pre>  //Parsing the json to object</pre>\n<pre>    sampleModel = <em>new </em>SampleModel.fromJson(json.decode(Strings.<em>SAMPLE_JSON</em>));<br><em>assert</em>(sampleModel != <em>null</em>);<br>  }<br><br>  @override<br>  Widget build(BuildContext context) {<br><em>return new </em>Scaffold(<br>      appBar: <em>new </em>AppBar(<br>        title: <em>new </em>Text(widget.title),<br>      ),<br>      body: <em>new </em>Center(<br>          child: <em>new </em>Column(<br>        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,<br>        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,<br>        children: &lt;Widget&gt;[<br>          Text("id: " + sampleModel.id, style: textStyle),<br>          Text("name: " + sampleModel.name, style: textStyle),<br>          Text("nickname: " + sampleModel.nickname, style: textStyle),<br>          Text("avatar: " + sampleModel.nickname, style: textStyle),<br>          Text("profileComplete: " + (sampleModel.profile_complete ? "Yes" : "No"), style: textStyle),<br>        ],<br>      )),<br>    );<br>  }<br>}</pre>\n<p>The output of the above code looks something like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/270/1*-08OVpf8s8Bl75MTB4cOVg.png"></figure><p>Pretty simple. We just parsed a basic JSON object.</p>\n<p>The above code will work fine till the time server returns JSON correctly. The problem starts, when JSON becomes quite large and it becomes difficult to debug when server returns JSON incorrectly. Let’s see how:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Case 1:</strong></blockquote>\n<p>For example, say, server didn’t return ‘profile_complete’ key i.e. your JSON looks something like this:</p>\n<pre>{<br> “id”: “12”,<br> “name”: “Ayush”,<br> “nickname”: “apgapg”,<br> “avatar”: “<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg</a>",</pre>\n<pre>// profile_complete key missing<br>}</pre>\n<p>The code will give error on run time because you are using the ‘profile_complete’ value while setting a text in homePage:</p>\n<pre>Text("profileComplete: " + (sampleModel.profile_complete ? "Yes" : "No"), style: textStyle)     //Throwing null pointer error</pre>\n<p>You might say “i can put a null check there” but it doesn’t make sense to put null check everywhere in your code. So why not validate JSON while parsing only?</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/json_annotation">json_annotation package</a> you can automate the whole process.</p>\n<p>We will now change our ‘ profile_complete’ key to look something like below. We will add an annotation ‘@JsonKey’ with some parameters like this:</p>\n<pre>@JsonKey(required: <em>true</em>)<br><em>final </em>bool profile_complete;</pre>\n<p>The docs about this ‘required’ method says:</p>\n<pre>{bool required} Static type: bool <br>When true, generated code for fromJson will verify that the source JSON map contains the associated key.<br>If the key does not exist, a MissingRequiredKeysException exception is thrown.<br>Note: only the existence of the key is checked. A key with a null value is considered valid.</pre>\n<p>The docs clearly states what will happen under the hood and I guess no further explanation is needed.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Case 2:</strong></blockquote>\n<p>What if server now returns ‘profile_complete’ key but with a null value. Something like this:</p>\n<pre>{<br> “id”: “12”,<br> “name”: “Ayush”,<br> “nickname”: “apgapg”,<br> “avatar”: “<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg</a>",<br> “profile_complete”: null<br>}</pre>\n<p>Again this will be an issue because you need a bool rather than a null value. Here’s how we can put a check again:</p>\n<pre>@JsonKey(disallowNullValue: <em>true</em>)<br><em>final </em>bool profile_complete;</pre>\n<p>Docs about ‘disallowNullValue’ says the following:</p>\n<pre>{bool disallowNullValue} Static type: bool <br>If true, generated code will throw a DisallowedNullValueException if the corresponding key exits, but the value is null.</pre>\n<pre>Note: this value does not affect the behavior of a JSON map without the associated key.<br>If [disallowNullValue] is true, [includeIfNull] will be treated as false to ensure compatibility between toJson and fromJson.<br>If both [includeIfNull] and [disallowNullValue] are set to true on the same field, an exception will be thrown during code generation.</pre>\n<blockquote><strong>Case 3:</strong></blockquote>\n<p>What if a case occurs where you want to assign default value to a key if it doesn’t exist in source JSON or its value is null. For example, Let’s say we want to assign default value to ‘profile_complete’ key if Case 1 or Case 2 occurs as above:</p>\n<pre>@JsonKey(defaultValue: <em>false</em>)<br><em>final </em>bool profile_complete;</pre>\n<p>This will now assign a default value to this key if its absent or its value is null.</p>\n<p>For ‘defaultValue’ docs says that:</p>\n<pre>{Object defaultValue} Static type: Object <br>The value to use if the source JSON does not contain this key or if the value is null.</pre>\n<blockquote><strong>Case 4:</strong></blockquote>\n<p>One more case can occur, which is when the server returns ‘profile_complete’ key with value not bool but string :</p>\n<pre>{<br> “id”: “12”,<br> “name”: “Ayush”,<br> “nickname”: “apgapg”,<br> “avatar”: “<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Oeijd1cy4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAf6o/e3VRuG09d48/s96-c/photo.jpg</a>",<br> “profile_complete”: "false"   //Note the data type its string now<br>}</pre>\n<blockquote>Don’t say the server needs to send proper data type or correct JSON. There can be cases where server may not be able to return the exact data type that is required at the client end and you are required to use the string(in this case) value only.</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t worry, even this can also be done i.e. the source data type can also be converted into different data type. You need ‘fromJson’ method:</p>\n<pre>@JsonKey(fromJson: _convertTobool)<br><em>final </em>bool profile_complete;</pre>\n<p>‘fromJson’ uses a method ‘_convertTobool’ which is defined somewhere like this:</p>\n<pre>bool _convertTobool(value) {<br><em>if </em>(value <em>is </em>String) {<br><em>if </em>(value.toLowerCase() == "true")<br><em>return true</em>;<br><em>else<br>      return false</em>;<br>  } <em>else<br>    return </em>value;<br>}</pre>\n<p>This method basically checks the data type of the value received in key’s value and converts it to the proper data type when required.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Case 5:</strong></blockquote>\n<p>Last but not the least, what if you want to use different field name to the one received in JSON. For example, we want to use ‘profile_complete’ key as ‘profileComplete’ in our code?</p>\n<p>Here’s the solution. Use the ‘name’ method in annotation like this:</p>\n<pre>@JsonKey(name:"profile_complete")<br><em>final </em>bool profileComplete;</pre>\n<p>Don’t forget to re-run the build runner every time you make a change i.e. run this command whenever changing the model:</p>\n<pre>flutter packages pub run build_runner build</pre>\n<p>That’s all for validating JSON returned from server. The complete sample code is available <a href="https://github.com/apgapg/flutter_json_parsing">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Whola! Both you and I learnt something new today. Congrats<br>Clap!
